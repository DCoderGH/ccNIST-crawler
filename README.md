# ccNIST-crawler

A python script to fetch various input and output [Gaussian] files of Computational Chemistry calculations from NIST database.

The hardcoded script fetches input files for 'C6H14' (2nd molecule) from https://cccbdb.nist.gov/gaufiles1.asp and stores one of the logfile(G3B3) in txt format.

Futher features being worked upon :
1. Feeding a dictionary of molecules
2. Fetching i/o files for all isomers etc in a single run
3. Storing files in a directory structure with proper names/details .
